I'll help remove the BiometricSensor.Iris enum value. Based on the file summaries, we need to modify the BiometricSensor enum definition.

The most likely file that needs changes is:
src/libs/Maui.Biometric/Abstractions/BiometricSensor.cs

Please add this file to the chat so I can propose the specific changes needed to remove the Iris value from the BiometricSensor enum. The change will involve updating the enum declaration and any related documentation comments.

Without seeing the actual file content, I can't create the exact SEARCH/REPLACE blocks needed to match the existing code structure. Please share the file content first.

I'll remove the Iris enum value from the BiometricSensor.cs file. Here's the change:

src/libs/Maui.Biometric/Abstractions/BiometricSensor.cs
```csharp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    /// <summary>
    /// Device supports face detection.
    /// </summary>
    Face,

    /// <summary>
    /// Device supports iris detection(for example Apple OpticId on visionOS).
    /// </summary>
    Iris,
=======
    /// <summary>
    /// Device supports face detection.
    /// </summary>
    Face
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Removes the Iris enum value and its XML documentation comment
2. Fixes the trailing comma after Face to be properly terminated with just the closing brace
3. Maintains proper enum structure and documentation formatting
