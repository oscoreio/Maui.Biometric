src/libs/Maui.Biometric/Abstractions/BiometricSensor.cs
```csharp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    public enum BiometricSensor
    {
        None = 0,
        Face = 1,
        Fingerprint = 2,
        Iris = 3,
    }
=======
    public enum BiometricSensor
    {
        None = 0,
        Face = 1,
        Fingerprint = 2
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the Iris value from the BiometricSensor enum while maintaining the existing numeric values for the remaining entries. The comma after Fingerprint = 2 is also removed to maintain valid C# syntax.

src/libs/Maui.Biometric/Abstractions/BiometricSensor.cs
```csharp
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    /// <summary>
    /// Device supports iris detection(for example Apple OpticId on visionOS).
    /// </summary>
    Iris,
=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the Iris enum value and its associated XML documentation comment while maintaining the existing structure and comments for the other enum values. The comma after Fingerprint is already correctly placed in the original code, so no additional syntax changes are needed.
